## Lesson Overview

In this lesson, students will discuss digital forensics investigations and incident response.

## Learning Objectives

- Discuss the digital investigation process.
- Discuss evidence acquisition.
- Explain a chain of custody.
- Discuss the role of forensics reporting.
- Discuss how forensics can be integrated into an IR plan.
- Explain how forensics can create cyber threat intelligence.

## Prerequisites

- read [Brian Carrier's paper](https://github.com/usma-eecs/cs483/blob/main/Lesson%201/Carrier%20-%20Open%20Source%20Forensics.pdf) 

## Lesson Topics

1. Review Questions
   - What can Digital Forensic Efforts Provide?
   - What is the Daubert Standard?
   - What are the Daubert Factors?
   - What is Locardâ€™s Exchange Principle?
   - What is the Observer Effect?

2. Paper Discussion
   - Discuss Brian Carrier's paper on the legal argument for open source digital forensics tools.
   - Relate this discussion to the key concepts from lesson 1.

3. Digital Investigations
   - A digital investigation is a process where we develop and test hypotheses that answer questions about digital events. This is done using the scientific method where we develop a hypothesis using evidence that we find and then test the hypothesis by looking for additional evidence that shows the hypothesis is impossible. Digital evidence is a digital object that contains reliable information that supports or refutes a hypothesis.
   - Best evidence rule.
   - Discuss the role of digital search warrant and OPSEC in an investigation.
   - Evidence acquisition.
   - Chain of custody.
   - Forensics reporting.
   - Integrate forensics into incident response (IR).
   - Incident response steps.
   - Forensics-driven cyber threat intelligence (CTI).
 
 4. EECSNet Orientation
    - Verify EECSnet access.
